Bear Game

The best bear based video game on the market. It will see you take life as a solitary bear who's sole aim in life is to collect the nearby fish and avoid being killed by the hunters that are out for your blood. Once you have earned enough points you will unlock a door to a neighbouring level. Each time you progress, the hunters progressively get harder to fight.

Intructions:

w - move forwards

a - move left

s- move backwards

d - move right

When you touch a fish it will be collected.
